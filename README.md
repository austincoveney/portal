## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd portal

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env.local

2. Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
3. Write meaningful commit messages
4. Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

## 🚀 Deployment
